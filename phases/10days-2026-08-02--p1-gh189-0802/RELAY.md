## Phase Brief

# Marathon preflight packet — gh-189-pulse-dashboard-residual-gaps

- Generated: 2026-08-02T17:45:55Z
- Mode: gh-bundle
- Sources: /Users/matthewtaylor/htdocs/rebalance-OS/PROJECT/2-WORKING/GH-189-PULSE-DASHBOARD-RESIDUAL-GAPS.md 
- Target root: /Users/matthewtaylor/htdocs/rebalance-OS (development @ 5b992a281)
- Suggested branch: `marathon/gh-189-pulse-dashboard-residual-gaps-2026-08-02` (branch_ready=false — carve-out: risk=1/independent zone, proceed on the current branch without asking)
- Verdict: ready
- Gate: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -k "doctor or pulse_web" -q`

- Artifacts: src/rebalance/doctor.py,scripts/pulse_web.py
- Suggested turn budget: `RELAY_TURN_TIMEOUT_S=900` (sized to ≈ 4721 LOC across 2 artifact(s); a build that also edits tests needs headroom over the 300s default)


This packet is the producer's output. The orchestrator launches the run; the planner does not
(GUIDING-PRINCIPLES.md §8).

## Acceptance criteria — the build is DONE when these hold (inlined from the capture doc)
- [ ] Health banner shows an absolute-anchored timestamp (via `format_timestamp()`),
- [ ] Repo-pie labels show short repo names (org prefix stripped), matching the
- [ ] No new time module or new stripping rule introduced — reuse existing helpers.
- [ ] `pytest -k "doctor or pulse_web"` green.

## Scope lock — builder, do exactly this and nothing else
- Edit ONLY: `src/rebalance/doctor.py,scripts/pulse_web.py` (plus the relay file). Any other edit is reverted and FAILS the turn.
- Do NOT run the full gate (`.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -k "doctor or pulse_web" -q`) yourself — it can create files that trip containment and discard your turn. Verify with ONLY the specific test for the file(s) you changed; the harness runs the gate after your turn.
- Do NOT analyze the roadmap, file issues, or refactor adjacent code. Implement the acceptance criteria above — nothing more.

## Debug mantra (auto-triggered — 2 prior attempt(s) on this phase did not reach Approved)

Before trying again, read /Users/matthewtaylor/htdocs/rebalance-OS/.xyz/relay-automation/DEBUG-MANTRA.md and follow its four-step discipline: reproduce reliably, know the fail path, question the hypothesis, treat this round as a breadcrumb for the next one.
Last recorded reason (/Users/matthewtaylor/htdocs/rebalance-OS/phases/10days-2026-08-02--p1-gh189-0802/ESCALATION.md): `pre-advance-failed`. Read it before re-guessing.

▶ TAKE YOUR TURN (claude — BUILDER role)

You are the BUILDER for this phase. Read the phase brief above and implement it.
1. Implement the brief by creating/editing the artifact file(s): src/rebalance/doctor.py,scripts/pulse_web.py
2. Append a build block to this relay file: `### Round N · Builder · claude` summarizing what you did (files touched, key decisions).
3. Use this exact tick binary (run it from any directory): /Users/matthewtaylor/htdocs/rebalance-OS/.xyz/bin/tick
   - /Users/matthewtaylor/htdocs/rebalance-OS/.xyz/bin/tick claim MARATHON-P1-GH189-0802-TURN-3 --agent claude --paths "phases/10days-2026-08-02--p1-gh189-0802/RELAY.md,src/rebalance/doctor.py,scripts/pulse_web.py"
   - /Users/matthewtaylor/htdocs/rebalance-OS/.xyz/bin/tick ping MARATHON-P1-GH189-0802-TURN-3 --agent claude
   - /Users/matthewtaylor/htdocs/rebalance-OS/.xyz/bin/tick release MARATHON-P1-GH189-0802-TURN-3 --agent claude --to agy
4. Edit ONLY these paths: phases/10days-2026-08-02--p1-gh189-0802/RELAY.md and src/rebalance/doctor.py,scripts/pulse_web.py. Do NOT run git. Do NOT touch any other file — the harness commits for you.
5. HAND OFF EXPLICITLY (GH-268): after releasing the token, end your turn by naming who acts next —
   "handing off to agy — agy, take your turn." A turn that ends without that line
   leaves a human guessing whether the relay is waiting on them or has stalled. Do this EVERY round,
   not just the first.

---

▶ TAKE YOUR TURN (agy — REVIEWER role)

You are the REVIEWER for this phase. Read the latest builder block above AND review the artifact file(s) on disk: src/rebalance/doctor.py,scripts/pulse_web.py. REVIEW THE WHOLE FILE, NOT JUST THE DIFF (GH-268): a beta test had this loop reach 'Approved' in two rounds while an independent audit of the same branch found 20 issues (1 critical, 4 high) — every one of them in the pre-existing code the change sat on, which nobody had read. Pre-existing defects in a file you are touching are IN SCOPE; say so explicitly if you find none. DECLARE IT: your review block MUST contain a literal 'swept file: yes' or 'swept file: no' line — without it a reviewer that skipped the sweep is indistinguishable in the transcript from one that did it and found nothing, which is exactly how those 20 issues stayed invisible.
1. Append a review block: `### Round N · Reviewer · agy` followed by your assessment.
2. If changes needed: add `**Verdict:** Changes requested` then: /Users/matthewtaylor/htdocs/rebalance-OS/.xyz/bin/tick release MARATHON-P1-GH189-0802-TURN-3 --agent agy --to claude
3. If satisfied: add `**Verdict:** Approved`, set `STATUS: Approved`, then: /Users/matthewtaylor/htdocs/rebalance-OS/.xyz/bin/tick done MARATHON-P1-GH189-0802-TURN-3 --agent agy
4. Use this exact tick binary (run it from any directory) for all token operations: /Users/matthewtaylor/htdocs/rebalance-OS/.xyz/bin/tick
   Edit ONLY phases/10days-2026-08-02--p1-gh189-0802/RELAY.md (your review block + STATUS). Do NOT edit the artifact yourself — request changes instead. Do NOT run git.
5. HAND OFF EXPLICITLY (GH-268): end your turn by naming who acts next — "handing off to claude —
   claude, take your turn" when requesting changes, or "relay closed, no further turn needed" when
   approving. The beta report singled this out: the Reviewer turn did not tell the user to go back to the
   Producer, so the relay looked stalled when it was simply waiting. Do this EVERY round.
