# M2 p2 — docs_index.py: projection and delta embedding

## Status

| What was just completed | What's next |
|---|---|
| Brief authored 2026-08-03 and preflighted — `marathon.sh --dry-run` resolves this phase in execution order. **Not yet run.** | Runs after `hiqs-m2-p1` is approved. |

**Canonical spec:** `HIQS-PROJECT.md` §6.1, §9 (`docs_vec` PK), §5 rule 2, §3.1 (Decision 1 —
`sentence-transformers`, torch backend), §11 (~130 LOC).

## Build

`HiQS/hiqs/docs_index.py`:
- raw → `docs` projection. **The sole writer to `docs`** (§5 rule 1).
- Delta-only embedding keyed by content hash, writing `docs_vec(doc_id, model, dim, vec)`.
  The **model name is part of the key**, so a model swap re-embeds lazily and two models' vectors
  coexist — that is what makes the Phase 1 comparison free of migration machinery.
- Within-unit reconciliation applied to **both** `docs` and `docs_vec` (§5 rule 2).

Embedding goes through `SentenceTransformer(...).encode()` and nothing else. Decision 1 is explicit
that hand-rolled pooling is rejected: wrong pooling or a missing L2 norm produces fast,
valid-looking, quietly degraded vectors and nothing throws (L8, twice in the incumbent).

## Acceptance

- A test asserts `docs` has exactly one writer.
- Delta behaviour: unchanged content re-runs with zero embed calls (assert the encoder is not
  called, don't time it).
- Both models resident: embed a fixture under two model names, assert both rows persist with
  correct `dim`, and that reading one does not return the other's vector.
- Reconciliation removes `docs_vec` rows for pruned chunks too — an orphaned vector is as
  corrupting as an orphaned doc row, and easier to miss.
- `embed_ms` and `peak_rss_mb` recorded in `SyncReport.meta` (§8, L7).
- Runs offline in tests: the encoder is stubbed. No network, no model download in the suite.

## Do not

- Do not implement pooling, normalization, or tokenization yourself (Decision 1, L8).
- Do not embed on every run "to be safe" — the delta is the design, and L7 is what unbounded
  embedding cost this machine.
